# MidModMuseum
 
The Midcentury Modern Museum is a VR Environment built for Meta Quest 2 in the Unity HD Render Pipeline.
It utilizes a PBR workflow to emphasize realistic textures and lighting dynamics.
The space itself is based on blueprints for a Case Study House from the acclaimed design program in the 1950's.
The home itself was never built, and I have taken some liberties with surface textures.
All artworks in the home were made by Artists who were working during the time period between 1950 and 1970.
I modeled, built and coded the entire project by myself.
